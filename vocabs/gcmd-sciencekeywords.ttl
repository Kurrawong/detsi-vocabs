climate. d18O (delta oxygen-18), 16O and 18O are isotopes of oxygen with slight
differences in atomic weight. Depending on the temperature of evaporation and
how far the water has had to travel before it fell as snow, the ratio of 18O to
16O will vary. This ratio, known as d18O, can be measured very accurately using
a mass spectrometer. Over short time scales the change in temperature from
summer to winter produces a very clear oscillation in the 18O/16O ratio. This
oscillation is used to determine the age of the core at different depths,
simply by counting the oscillations. Over longer time periods, this ratio
indicates the average temperature of the regions between the evaporation site
and the coring site. Investigators in Greenland and Antarctica are also
analyzing for the ratio of 1H/2H (Hydrogen to deuterium) which will allow even
finer detail about source temperature and condensation history to be obtained."""@en ;

preexisting topography. Most abyssal plains are located between the base of the
continental rise and the abyssal hills. The remainder are trench abyssal plains

zonal wind equals the climatological value for that time period, the

Halons are used as fire extinguishing agents, both in built-in systems and in handheld portable fire extinguishers. Halon production in the U.S. ended on December 31, 1993, because they contribute to ozone depletion. They cause ozone depletion because they contain bromine. Bromine is many times more effective at destroying ozone than chlorine. At the time the current U.S. tax code was adopted, the ozone depletion potentials of halon 1301 and halon 1211 were observed to be 10 and 3, respectively. These values are used for tax calculations. Recent scientific studies, however, indicate that the ODPs are at least 12 and 6, respectively. Note: technically, all compounds containing carbon and fluorine and/or chlorine are halons, but in the context of the Clean Air Act, "halon" means a fire extinguishing agent as described above. A table of class I substances (http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/ods/classone.html) shows their ODPs, GWPs, and CAS numbers. Halons are numbered according to a standard scheme."""@en ;

infrared radiation. Atmospheric CO2 has increased about 25 percent since the
early 1800s, with an estimated increase of 10 percent since 1958 (burning
fossil fuels is the leading cause of increased CO2, deforestation the second
major cause). The increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance the
greenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into space and contributing to
the warming of Earth's lower atmosphere. (Earth Observatory)
The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
for periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gas
inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice caps. The most widely
accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate
that atmospheric CO2 levels were about 260¿280uL/L immediately before
industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the
preceding 10,000 years. 
The longest ice core record comes from Vostok, Antarctica, where ice has been
sampled to a depth of 3,600 meters, corresponding to an age of 420,000 years
before the present. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentration has varied between 180¿210 uL/L during ice ages, increasing to
280¿300 uL/L during warmer
interglacials.(http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Carbon-dioxide)"""@en ;

text: Microfossils are the tiny remains of bacteria, protists, fungi, animals, and plants. Microfossils are a heterogeneous bunch of fossil remains studied as a single discipline because rock samples must be processed in certain ways to remove them and microscopes must be used to study them. Thus, microfossils, unlike other kinds of fossils, are not grouped according to their relationships to one another, but only because of their generally small size and methods of study. For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology. 

Microfossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain. Paleoenvironmental analysis is the interpretation of the depositional environment in which the rock unit formed, based upon the fossils found within the unit. There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation.

One way to capture earth's record of that proxy data is to drill deep ice cores. Greenland, due to having a large and relatively stable deep ice sheet is often the target for drilling ice cores.

Isotopic analysis of the ice in the core can be linked to temperature and global sea level variations. Analysis of the air contained in bubbles in the ice can reveal the palaeocomposition of the atmosphere, in particular CO2 variations. Volcanic eruptions leave identifiable ash layers.

While it sounds simple to analyze, there are issues of ice compression, flow, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when doing reconstructions from such data.

the Colorado Climate Center in 1993. The purpose is to assign a single
numeric value to the precipitation which can be compared across
regions with markedly different climates. Technically, the SPI is the
number of standard deviations that the observed value would deviate
from the long-term mean, for a normally distributed random
variable. Since precipitation is not normally distributed, a
transformation is first applied so that the transformed precipitation
values follow a normal distribution.
The Standardized Precipitation Index was designed to explicitly
express the fact that it is possible to simultaneously experience wet
conditions on one or more time scales, and dry conditions at other
time scales, often a difficult concept to convey in simple terms to
decision-makers. Consequently, a separate SPI value is calculated for
a selection of time scales, covering the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months, and ending

text: The summer polar mesopause is the coldest region of the Earth's atmosphere, reaching temperatures as low as -140°C. It is sufficiently cold for noctilucent ('night shining') clouds to form in summer, at altitudes around 83 km. 

Noctilucent clouds can only be seen when the sun is shining on them (at ~83 km) and not on the lower atmosphere, i.e. when the sun is between 6 and 16 degrees below the horizon.

They are a summer, polar phenomena but because of the restrictive viewing conditions they are most commonly observed at latitudes between 55 and 65 degrees. 

Noctilucent clouds were first reported in 1885 when they were independently observed in Germany and Russia. This was two years after the volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Java.

One hypothesis is that the initial observation of noctilucent clouds was related to an increase in the number of observers of the twilight skies attracted by the spectacular displays resulting from the globally distributed volcanic debris of Krakatoa. Alternatively, water vapour injected into the upper atmosphere by the volcano ultimately reached the cold, dry upper mesophere.

Subsequent observations have proved that noctilucent clouds are not solely related to volcanic activity, and their volcanic association is now scientifically contentious. It has been alternatively claimed that the appearance of noctilucent clouds is the earliest evidence of anthropogenic climate change.

Noctilucent cloud observations from north-west Europe over the last 30 years show an increasing trend in the number of nights on which the clouds are observed each summer season, superimposed on a decadal variability that appears to be solar-cycle related.

Competing anthropogenic explanations for this increasing occurrence of noctilucent clouds focus on either excessive greenhouse cooling of the middle atmosphere or increased water vapour linked to increased methane release associated principally with intensive farming activities.

They have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but less than 100 observations have been reported from the southern hemisphere. It has not been resolved if this is due to inter-hemispheric differences (temperature &/or water vapour) in the atmosphere at these altitudes, or the lack of observers and poorer observing conditions in southern latitudes.

text: Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play a central role in the formation of the ozone hole in the Antarctic and Arctic. PSCs provide surfaces upon which heterogeneous chemical reactions take place. These reactions lead to the production of free radicals of chlorine in the stratosphere which directly destroy ozone molecules.

PSCs form poleward of about 60ºS latitude in the altitude range 10 km to 25 km during the winter and early spring. The clouds are classified into Types I and II according to their particle size and formation temperature.

Type II clouds, also known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, are composed of ice crystals and form when temperatures are below the ice frost point (typically below -83ºC).

The Type I PSCs are optically much thinner than the Type II clouds, and have a formation threshold temperature 5 to 8ºC above the frost point. These clouds consist mainly of hydrated droplets of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.

Despite two decades of research, the climatology of PSCs is not well described, and this impacts on the accuracy of ozone depletion models. The timing and duration of PSC events, their geographic extent and vertical distributions, and their annual variability are not well understood.The Davis lidar has been used to study stratospheric clouds since 2001. The observations consist of profiles of Rayeligh laser backscatter at a wavelength of 532 nm as a function of altitude. The measurements are being used to investigate the climatology of the clouds and their relation to the temperature structure of the stratosphere, and the influence of atmospheric gravity waves and planetary waves in modulating their structure and ozone depletion.

    skos:definition """Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was discovered by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm
Scheele in 1782, who prepared it from the pigment Prussian blue (hence its
other name of prussic acid). <p>
There are many naturally occurring substances yielding cyanide in certain
seeds, such as the pit of the wild cherry. It usually occurs in combination
with plant sugars. The tuberous edible plant of the spurge family called
cassava (also known as manioc, mandioc, or yuca) was used by primitive peoples
to produce HCN for poison darts and arrows. HCN is produced by other plants,
bacteria and fungi. Emissions from CN radicals are occasionally observed from
lightning disturbed air. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by biomass burning since
nitrogen in plant material is mostly present as amino acids and upon combustion
this nitrogen is emitted as a variety of compounds including NH3, NO, NO2, N2O,
organic nitriles and nitrates. It is interesting to note that the atmospheric
measurements of HCN reported by Zander et al. (1988) gave a mixing ratio for
HCN in the Southern Hemisphere which was approximately 5% higher than that for
the Northern Hemisphere. This may be due to biomass burning.
There are many anthropogenic sources of compounds containing CN which can be
released into the atmosphere. Cyanides are used in a variety of chemical
processes including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel,
electroplating and in the concentration of ores. Hydrogen cyanide is used to
prepare polyacrylonitrile fibres (known by the generic name of acrylic)
synthetic rubber, plastics, and in gas masers to produce a wavelength of 3.34
mm. Hydrogen cyanide is a combustion product which is a human hazard during
domestic and industrial fires and from tobacco smoking. Some catalytic
converters in bad repair can produce large amounts of Hydrogen cyanide.
Hydrogen cyanide is produced in large quantities for laboratory and commercial
use by three principle methods: Treatment of sodium cyanide with sulphuric
acid, catalytic oxidation of a methane-ammonia mixture, and decomposition of
formamide (HCONH2)."""@en ;

they are made of, for example snow, ice, rock or soil avalanches. A mixture of
these would be called a debris avalanche.  <br><br>
A large avalanche can run for miles, and can create massive destruction of the 
lower forest and anything else in its path. Avalanches occur when the load on
the upper snow layers exceeds bonding forces (bonding to layer beneath, support
from anchors such as rocks and trees, stress support from top or bottom of
slope). Critical load may be exceeded naturally by adding new snow or by rapid 
loading, by falling ice, cornices and similar means. The bonding forces within 
a snowpack are affected by temperatures (e.g., a lubricated melt layer, or a
fragile crystal layer) before, during and after snowfall. Avalanches are also 
triggered by humans - because of the additional weight, kicks during skiing 
(e.g. during jumps) or intentionally by explosives, slope-cuts and other means.

complex models in use, consisting of an Atmosphere general circulation model
(AGCM) coupled to an Ocean general circulation models (OGCM). With the addition
of other components (such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration
over land), the AOGCM becomes the basis for a full climate model. 
Some recent models include the biosphere, carbon cycle and atmospheric
chemistry as well. AOGCMs can be used for the prediction and rate of change of
future climate. They are also used to study the variability and physical
processes of the coupled climate system. Global climate models typically have a
resolution of a few hundred kilometres. Climate projections from the Hadley
Centre make use of the HadCM2 AOGCM, developed in 1994, and its successor
HadCM3 AOGCM, developed in 1998. Greenhouse-gas experiments with AOGCMs have
usually been driven by specifying atmospheric concentrations of the gases, but
if a carbon cycle model is included, the AOGCM can predict changes in carbon
dioxide concentration, given the emissions of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere. Similarly, an AOGCM coupled to an atmospheric chemistry model is
able to predict the changes in concentration of other atmospheric constituents
in response to climate change and to the changing emissions of various gases.
Further information is available on: some aspects of ocean simulation in HadCM3
(thermohaline circulation, ventilation, vertical mixing), decadal variability
in the ocean of HadCM3.
Recently a global coupled climate model with an eddy-permitting ocean
resolution has been developed at the Hadley Centre, in order to better
represent important oceanic processes. """@en ;

These regions capture the largest precipitation anomalies associated with the interannual variations of the Walker circulation and contain the largest correlations between GPCP and Nino 3.4 and SOI. Within P and MC the absolute magnitude of the largest correlation is over +0.6. 

Because of the spatially varying nature of rainfall, it was decided to use a moving block average which would capture the strongest zonal gradients within the equatorial Pacific. This procedure is unlike many fixed area average indices, and allows for a realistic meridional component of the precipitation gradient and migration of the ascending and descending branches of the Walker circulation.

text: In cloud physics, the merging of two water drops into a single larger drop after collision.

Coalescence between colliding drops is affected by the impact energy, which tends to increase with the higher fall velocities of larger drops. Colliding drops having negligible impact energy compared to their surface energy behave as water spheres that collide with a collision efficiency (the fraction of small drops that collide with a large drop within the geometric collision cross section) predicted by the theory for falling spheres. The result of increasing impact energy is to flatten the colliding drops at the point of impact, impeding the drainage of the air and delaying contact between them. As the distortion relaxes, the drops rebound, reducing the coalescence efficiency for cloud drops and drizzle drops colliding with smaller drops. At larger impact energy, separation will occur if the rotational energy (fixed by conservation of angular momentum) is higher than the surface energy of the coalescing drops. This phenomenon, termed temporary coalescence, can result in satellite droplets considerably smaller than either of the parent drops. This phenomenon is also called partial coalescence because the large drop may gain mass as a result of the higher internal pressure in the small drop. At still larger impact energy, drop breakup occurs for the smaller drop. About 20% of the high-energy collisions between large raindrops (d > 3 mm) and drizzle drops (d > 0.2 mm) result in the disintegration of both drops. Other factors that affect coalescence are electric charge and electric field, both of which promote coalescence, leading to earlier onset of coalescence during an interaction so that coalescence efficiencies are increased by suppression of rebound and temporary coalescence. All of these processes are important in formation of precipitation in all liquid clouds both above and below 0°C.

text: Degree days are based on the assumption that when the outside temperature is 65°F, we don't need heating or cooling to be comfortable. Degree days are the difference between the daily temperature mean, (high temperature plus low temperature divided by two) and 65°F.

Example 1: The high temperature for a particular day was 90°F and the low temperature was 66°F. The temperature mean for that day was:

( 90°F + 66°F ) / 2 = 78°F

Because the result is above 65°F:
78°F - 65°F = 13 Cooling Degree Days


Example 2: The high temperature for a particular day was 33°F and the low temperature was 25°F. The temperature mean for that day was:

( 33°F + 25°F ) / 2 = 29°F

Because the result is below 65°F:

65°F - 29°F = 36 Heating Degree Days.

The calculations shown in the two examples above are performed for each day of the year and the daily degree days are accumulated so that we can compare months and seasons.

In addition to saving the CO2 emissions (if the H2 is formed from carbon-free energy sources), also the massive energy-related emissions of other compounds like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and soot could be drastically reduced, leading to improvements in air quality (Schultz et al., 2003). Nevertheless, unavoidable leakage in the production, distribution, storage and consumption of H2 could drastically alter the mixing ratio of H2 in the atmosphere. Although it is not a greenhouse gas itself, H2 affects the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane and many other species via its reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical (Schultz et al.,2003). In addition, H2 is an important source for stratospheric water vapor, which provides the substrate for polar stratospheric clouds that play a key role in the formation of the stratospheric polar ozone hole. Therefore, increasing levels of H2 in the atmosphere will counteract the predicted recovery of the ozone hole (Tromp et al., 2003; Warwick et al.,2004; Feck et al., 2008)."@en ;

flows off the west coast of South America, carrying warm,
low-salinity, nutrient-poor water to the south. It does not usually
extend farther than a few degrees south of the equator, but
occasionally it does penetrate beyond 12 degrees S, displacing the
relatively cold Peru Current. The effects of this phenomenon are
generally short-lived, and fishing is only slightly
disrupted. Occasionally (in 1891, 1925, 1941, 1957 - 58, 1965, 1972 -
73, 1976, and 1982 - 83), the effects are major and prolonged. Under
these conditions, sea surface temperatures rise along the coast of
Peru and in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean and may remain high
for more than a year, having disastrous effects on marine life and
fishing. Excessive rainfall and flooding occur in the normally dry
coastal area of western tropical South America during these
events. Some oceanographers and meteorologists consider only the
major, prolonged events as El Nino phenomena rather than the annually
occurring weaker and short-lived ones. The name was originally applied
to the latter events because of their occurrence at Christmas time.

<p>
Interacting parts of a single global system of climate
fluctuations. ENSO is the most prominent known source of interannual
variability in weather and climate around the world, though not all
areas are affected. The Southern Oscillation (SO) is a global-scale
seesaw in atmospheric pressure between Indonesia/North Australia, and
the southeast Pacific. In major warm events El Nino warming extends
over much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked to the SO
pattern. Many of the countries most affected by ENSO events are
developing countries with economies that are largely dependent upon
their agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food
supply, employment, and foreign exchange. New capabilities to predict
the onset of ENSO event can have a global impact. While ENSO is a
natural part of the Earth's climate, whether its intensity or
frequency may change as a result of global warming is an important
concern.

oscillation, which became known as the Madden and Julian

months; second, the climatic fingerprints of the PDO are most visible
in the North Pacific/North American sector, while secondary signatures
exist in the tropics - the opposite is true for ENSO.
Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles
in the past century: "cool" PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and
again from 1947-1976 while"warm" PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946
and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Shoshiro Minobe; has
shown that 20th century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two
general periodicities, one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from
50-to-70 years."""@en ;

    skos:definition """The East Atlantic (EA) pattern is the second prominent mode of low-frequency variability over the North Atlantic, and appears as a leading mode in all months. The EA pattern is structurally similar to the NAO, and consists of a north-south dipole of anomaly centers spanning the North Atlantic from east to west. The anomaly centers of the EA pattern are displaced southeastward to the approximate nodal lines of the NAO pattern. For this reason, the EA pattern is often interpreted as a “southward shifted” NAO pattern. However, the lower-latitude center contains a strong subtropical link in association with modulations in the subtropical ridge intensity and location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern distinct from its NAO counterpart. This EA pattern is similar to that shown in the Barnston and Livezey (1987) study, but is distinctly different from the EA pattern originally defined by Wallace and Gutzler (1981).

The positive phase of the EA pattern is associated with above-average surface temperatures in Europe in all months, and with below-average temperatures over the southern U.S. during January-May and in the north-central U.S. during July-October. It is also associated with above-average precipitation over northern Europe and Scandinavia, and with below-average precipitation across southern Europe.

The EA pattern exhibits very strong multi-decadal variability in the 1950-2004 record, with the negative phase prevailing during much of 1950-1976, and the positive phase occurring during much of 1977-2004. The positive phase of the EA pattern was particularly strong and persistent during 1997-2004, when 3-month running mean values routinely averaged 1.0-2.0 standard deviations above normal."""@en ;

text: The Tropical/ Northern Hemisphere pattern was first classified by Mo and Livezey (1986), and appears as a prominent mode from November-February. The pattern consists of one primary anomaly center over the Gulf of Alaska and a separate anomaly center of opposite sign over the Hudson Bay. A weaker area of anomalies having similar sign to the Gulf of Alaska anomaly extends across Mexico and the extreme southeastern United States. This pattern reflects large-scale changes in both the location and eastward extent of the Pacific jet stream, and also in the strength and position of the climatological mean Hudson Bay Low. Thus, the pattern significantly modulates the flow of marine air into North America, as well as the southward transport of cold Canadian air into the north-central United States.

text: The mode describes the meridional variabilty in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.

Calculation Method:
The AMM spatial pattern is defined via applying Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) to sea surface temperature (SST; left field) and the zonal and meridional components of the 10m wind field (right field) over the time period 1950-2005, from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. To define the spatial pattern, data are defined over the region (21S-32N, 74W-15E), and spatially smoothed (three longitude by two latitude points). The seasonal cycle is removed, data are detrended, a three-month running mean is applied to the data, and the linear fit to the Cold Tongue Index (a measure of ENSO variability) is subtracted from each spatial point. Spatial patterns are defined as the first left (SST) and right (winds) maps resulting from singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix between the two fields. The AMM time series below is calculated via projecting SST or the 10m wind field (detrended, CTI removed, but no 3-month running mean) onto the spatial structure resulting from the MCA above.

text: The Environmental Vulnerability Index.
 		 
A vulnerability index for the natural environment, the basis of all human welfare, has been developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and their partners. The index was developed through consultation and collaboration with countries, institutions and experts across the globe. This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.

The reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a country’s development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience. With this information to hand, the outcome for countries could be optimised for their unique situations and development goals.
